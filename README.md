### OptimiTech (2017 - 2020)

[Iraq, Mosul](link)

Optimitech was started by myself and four other classmates. It is a volunteer initiative consisting of a nonprofit online electronics store that provides students free tech support, free robotics workshops for school kids from 10 to 16 years, and others related to IoT and Embedded systems basics. In this initiative, I have volunteered as an Events Coordinator, Public relations, and Instructor.
